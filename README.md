# Database Description:

The data set that we chose to analyze and formulate hypothetical questions based on is called Real Estate Sales 2001-2020 GL. This data set was last updated on August 12, 2023, and it was published on the DATA.GOV website by Metadata on November 12, 2023. This dataset is huge; it contains 997,214 rows of data entry. A brief skim of the data set, specifically focusing on the “Town” column reveals that this data set contains information for houses across Connecticut, a state in the United States of America. This data set contains quantitative variables such as the Assessed Value of the property and the Sale Amount of the property. The data set also contains categorical variables such as the Property Type and Residential Type. These categorical variables can be useful when looking into more specific hypotheticals; we have an example of this later in our project. 

In terms of data types, this data set consists of 5 different data types. Serial Number (the “primary key” for this data set) is an INT data type. List Year is a YEAR data type. Date Recorded is of data type DATE. The most common data type in this data set is VARCHAR. Town, Address, Property Type, Residential Type, Assessor Remarks, and Location are all of data type VARCHAR. Finally, Assessed Value and Sale Amount are type DECIMAL, and Sales Ratio is of data type FLOAT.
